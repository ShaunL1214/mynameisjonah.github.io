		<h2>My Skills</h2>
		
		<p>I play baseball pretty much daily. The team I play for is called the El Monte Dukes. We are a major division 13u travel baseball team. I also play basketball at lunch because it is very fun! My handles are like Kyrie Irving's handles and my shot is as wet as Stephen Curry's. FAX! I am very beast at NBA 2K17! My MyPark rep is an all star 4 (about to be all star 5) and my MyTeam is an 86 overall. At school, I am one of the fastest typers in my class. I can type over 80 WPM.</p>
		
		
		
		
		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		 <p>My two hobbies are Basketball and Baseball! I love playing these sports because they are very fun! Although, baseball is my favorite, I still really like basketball. My favorite basketball player is Russell Westbrook because he is very aggressive and energetic. My favorite baseball player is Mike Trout because he has all of the tools to be the G.O.A.T. of baseball. That's FAX! </p>
