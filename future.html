		<h2>Career Interests</h2>
	<p>I would love to be a Major League Baseball player, but it takes a lot of hard work and determination, which I am willing to do. 
	Also, I would love to do something that uses computers, maybe a computer programer, photoshop artist, etc...</p>
		
		
		<h2>Goals</h2>
		 <p>My goals are getting through middle school, going to high school, getting through high school, going to college, and finishing college so I can get a well paying job.
