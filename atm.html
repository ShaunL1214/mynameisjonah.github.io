		<h2>7th Grade Learning</h2>
		 <p>In 7th grade I learned how to use PhotoShop, Sketch Up, Floorplanner,and khan acadamey. My personal favorite was PhotoShop because we got to use our imagination and create something awesome! Sketch Up was also a very fun program because it allowed us to create houses, museums, castles, and more.... Another one of my favorite programs is floorplanner. Our job was to get a classrooms measurements and cut it down to size. Then we inserting the measurements into floorplanner and POOF! We made one of the classrooms at our school.</p>
